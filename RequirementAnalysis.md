# Requirement Analysis #

## Summary ##

Our project is based on the idea of reviving the cultural heritage which is getting lost. It lets users interact each other. Naturally, the same area will have diverse stories changing after some time and distinctive angles from distinctive perspectives relying upon every individual. At the point when glance at any memory, the map will demonstrate its location.

We are interested in how people are related those cultural tools (pictures, food, music) and where they came from. We want people to get knowledge from each other by their memories. Furthermore, the system suggestion brings users who are interested in the same history together. To do so, we use tagging. Users can like, dislike, vote and comment their sharings.

Individuals will have the capacity to peruse and impart their stories from this time and area with the help of pictures, features and sound recordings.These stories can also be semantically searched by location, rating, categories and so on. Also, we recommend users new stories based on their search parameters such as time, their age, where they live, and what theyâ€™ve liked before.

Furthermore, there will be a report system for the inappropriate stories and fake accounts/pins.

## Background ##

Our project aims to create a platform for people to share their memories and their thoughts about cultural heritage. We want our users to revive the cultural heritage that are getting lost as time goes by.

The aim of this document is to explain the requirements of our 'Cultural Heritage Project' with glossary and explanations of requirements. In Glossary subsection, users can see what terms mean specifically. Requirements subsection lists the features that our application has to implement. It is mostly the technical part of the project. Requirements section is also divided into subsections to give a better idea and be systematic. It has sign up / log in part to list requirements for guests, and user requirements to specify the authority of the users.
