# Personal Info #

Hi, I am a senior student in CmpE, currently in 10th semester. I graduated from Erzincan Science High school.
I was treasurer of _CompeC_ and member of _Bogazici Rowing Team_ formerly. I like reading books, going to theater and hanging out with my friends. I am also interested in both eating and making dessert.
