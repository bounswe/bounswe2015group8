## Notes ##

The idea is that cultural heritages are getting lost. So we aim to revive them. There are lots of stories about every culture. We can get different aspects from them. We are interested in how people related to those cultural things (pictures, food, music) or where they came from.

Some stories may be common or at least have common parts of it. So this is the place to share them.
The domain allows users to meet other cultures, as well. Because we stick on our own cultures.

Cultures are influenced by each other. There are both academic articles and people stories that we can get information from.

Tagging is very useful to bring people who are interested in the same issues. They can interact each other by the system suggestion because our system is able to detect them by considering their tags or picks. People are also able to vote other people's shares or report them. Allowing users to report is also important to find fake posts.
