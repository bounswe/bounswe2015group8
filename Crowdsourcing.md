# What is Crowdsourcing? #

**Crowdsourcing** is the process of getting work or funding, usually online, from a crowd of people. The word is a combination of the words _crowd_ and _outsourcing_. The idea is to take work and outsource it to a crowd of workers.

# Pros & Cons #

  * The ability to receive better quality results, since several people offer their best ideas, skills and support.
  * Allows you to select the best result from a sea of ‘best entries,’ as opposed to receiving the best entry from a single provider.
  * Results delivered much quicker than traditional methods, since crowdsourcing is a form of freelancing.

  * Clear instructions are essential in crowdsourcing.
  * Thousands of possible ideas, which can be painstaking, or even complicated.
  * Some forms of crowdsourcing do involve spec work, which some people are against.
  * Quality can be difficult to judge if proper expectations are not clearly stated.

# Examples #
There are some common categories of crowdsourcing that can be used effectively in the commercial world.

  * _Crowdvoting_ occurs when a website gathers a large group's opinions and judgment on a certain topic. For instance, Coca Cola has thus crowdsourced a pizza bottle design.
  * _Crowdsourcing_ has also been used for gathering _language-related data_. For dictionary work, over a hundred years ago it was applied by the Oxford English Dictionary editors, using paper and postage.
  * _Crowdfunding_ is the process of funding your projects by a multitude of people contributing a small amount in order to attain a certain monetary goal, typically via the Internet. One of the best known example is Kickstarter.
  * _Mobile crowdsourcing_ involves crowdsourcing activities that take place on smartphones or mobile platforms, frequently characterized by GPS technology. Uber is the one of the many examples.
  * _Microwork_ is a crowdsourcing platform where users do small tasks for which computers lack aptitude for low amounts of money. Amazon’s popular Mechanical Turk has created many different projects for users to participate in, where each task requires very little time and offers a very small amount in payment.
  * Web-based idea competitions or _inducement prize contests_ often consist of generic ideas, cash prizes, and an Internet-based platform to facilitate easy idea generation and discussion. An example of these competitions includes an event like the Netflix Prize in 2009.
  * _Implicit crowdsourcing_ is less obvious because users do not necessarily know they are contributing, yet can still be very effective in completing certain tasks. The best known example is reCAPTCHA.
