# Cultural Heritage #
Our group will work on a crowdsourcing project which provide a space for contributing information about Cultural Heritage. Our aim is to enable users to provide alternative opinions and stories about the artifacts. Users' contributions will be either text, audio, video or some combination of those three.

The project will be web based and it will also have an Android application. An API will be developed to serve the clients.
